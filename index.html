        Currently a Board Member of the University of Rome Tre, I'm a graduate student with a passion for macroeconomics, finance, mathematics, and programming.
        Whenever possible, I contribute to making society a better place through direct involvement in institutions.
        I interned in the business consulting sector to improve my business skills..
