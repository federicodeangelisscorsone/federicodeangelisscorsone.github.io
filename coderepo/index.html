    <h1> Federico De Angelis Scorsone's code repositories</h1>


    <h3> Coding challenges </h3>
    <p> Since I like spend some of my free time by completing coding challenges, I decided to create a repository where publish some solutions. 
    At the moment I'm focused on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/"> Project Euler </a> and <a href="https://cses.fi/problemset/text/2433"> CSES </a> problems. 
    I sometimes look also at <a href="https://www.janestreet.com/puzzles/"> Jane street </a> puzzles but only in a curious way. 
    These programming challenges allow to strengthen my coding skills, which is a different way to state that the code you are going to find is not always very optimized. 
    It's something I'm working on :P . I mainly use MATLAB / Octave but I'm looking to try some of new coding languages.

    <h3> Financial tools </h3>
    I'm working on a open repository with useful financial tools. I'll publish here the information as soon as possible.
